            <p>There are three types of discs: drivers, midranges, and putters.</p>
            <p>All discs have four numbers that appear on them. These numbers correspond to a certain 'stat' that the particular disc has.</p>
            <p>The numbers that appear on them (in order) mean:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Speed</th>
                    <th>Glide</th>
                    <th>Turn</th>
                    <th>Fade</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Values:</td>
                    <td>1 to 14</td>
                    <td>1 to 7</td>
                    <td>+1 to -5</td>
                    <td>0 to 5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Description:</td>
                    <td>Speed is the rate at which a disc can travel through the air. Speed 14 Distance Drivers are the fastest, 
                        having the PDGA maximum legal wing width. Faster discs cut into the wind with less effort and are best when 
                        throwing up wind. Slower discs take more power to throw upwind, but they’re easier to throw more accurately 
                        and may actually go farther downwind. High speed discs are not recommended for beginners as they require more 
                        power to fly properly.</td>
                    <td>Glide describes the discs ability to maintain loft during flight. Discs with more glide are best for new 
                        players, and for producing maximum distance. Beginners wanting more distance should choose discs with more 
                        glide. Discs with less glide are more accurate in high wind situations.</td>
                    <td>High Speed Turn is the tendency of a disc to turn over or bank to the right (for RHBH throws) during the 
                        initial part of the flight. A disc with a +1 rating is most resistant to turning over, while a -5 rating 
                        will turn the most. Discs rated -3 to -5 make good roller discs. Discs with less turn are more accurate in 
                        the wind. Discs with more turn are easier to throw for beginners.</td>
                    <td>Low Speed Fade is the discs tendency to hook left (for RHBH throws) at the end of the flight. Fade is rated 
                        from 0 to 5. A disc rated 0 will finish straightest, while a disc rated 5 will hook hard at the end of the 
                        flight. High fade discs are usually used for Spike and Skip shots.</td>

            <p>While all baskets are extremely similar, you may find small tweaks and differences between different brands and models.
               Much like how a car company produces multiple makes and models of vehicles.
